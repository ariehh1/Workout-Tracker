# Workout-Tracker

In this repository, I have built a Workout Tracker utilizing MongoDB and a Mongoose schema. The user can log their exercise activity for the day and view their results in the Workout Dashboard. The application will take in any resistance or cardio related exercise.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
The overall goal of this application was to design the back-end logic in order for the front-end to display exercise results. All of the starter front-end code was provided in the beginning of the assignment and can be found within the public directory of this repository. Connecting a MongoDB to the application, creating a Mongoose schema, and handling the API routes with Express were all developed in creating the Workout Tracker.
