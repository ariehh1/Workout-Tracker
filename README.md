# Workout-Tracker

In this repository, I have built a Workout Tracker utilizing MongoDB and a Mongoose schema. The user can log their exercise activity for the day and view their results in the Workout Dashboard. The application will take in any resistance or cardio related exercise.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
The overall goal of this application was to design the back-end logic in order for the front-end to display exercise results. All of the starter front-end code was provided in the beginning of the assignment and can be found within the public directory of this repository. Connecting a MongoDB to the application, creating a Mongoose schema, and handling the API routes with Express were all developed in creating the Workout Tracker.

<h1>User Story:</h1>
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

<h1>Business Context:</h1>
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
<li>MongoDB - (https://www.mongodb.com/)</li>
<li>Mongoose - (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html)</li>
<li>jQuery - (https://api.jquery.com/)</li>
<li>Bootstrap - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)</li>

<h1>Setup:</h1>
<li>Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "npm run watch"</li>
<li>Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "App running on http://localhost:3000"</li>
<li>In your browser, type "http://localhost:3000/"</li>

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to develop this application further, I would start with an API functionality. Google Maps first comes to mind when tracking a cardio workout. Once the user has logged their exercise into the tracker, they additionally have the option to add their coordinates (if they traveled from one place to another). I would also add in another schema where a set of exercise plans become visible if the user wishes to explore that route.
